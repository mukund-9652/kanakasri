        <h2>The Art of Yoga</h2>

            In recent decades, yoga has expanded to a global phenomenon. A
            contemplative technique that originated in the East thousands of
            years ago has developed into a trendy way of life that brings in
            billions of dollars today. This is due to yoga's adaptabilityâ€”people
            from diverse backgrounds can practise it and reap its advantages.
            Even people who don't practise yoga seem to know someone who does
            because so many famous people vouch for its physical and spiritual
            benefits. Practitioners frequently use words like peace, calm,
            balance, strength, flexibility, and relaxation to describe their
            experiences. However, what precisely is yoga? And how far from its
            historical roots has this practise deviated? The Sanskrit term for
            yoga means "yoke" or "unity." To bring together, to bind together,
            or to unify is to yoke. It seeks to yoke or bring about a union of
            the physical body, mental state, spiritual state, and global
            awareness. Deep states of liberation, tranquilly, and
            self-realization are only possible for yogis through the process of
            merging the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual elements of
            oneself.

            Yoga is a method of emancipation and self-discovery via meditation.
            It is an eclectic group of techniques meant to calm the mind,
            identify an objective witness consciousness, and break free from the
            cycle of birth and death. It teaches us to go inward, recognise the
            truth of who we are, and let rid of anything that does not benefit
            us. It enables us to become conscious of our feelings, thoughts, and
            beliefs and to alter them when they are no longer beneficial to us.
            It equips us with the means to lead more fully and to make wiser
            decisions in life. Our bodies, minds, and souls can all be
            transformed and purified through the practise of yoga. It broadens
            our consciousness to facilitate our interaction with the natural
            world and the cosmos. In addition, it increases our ability to tap
            into our inner resources, which can instruct us in self-awareness,
            acceptance, patience, gratitude, forgiveness, humility, and life.
